=============

Does my name break the subdomain syntax?


[RFC 1035](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt) states:

> The labels must follow the rules for ARPANET host names.  They must start with a letter, end with a letter or digit, and have as interior characters only letters, digits, and hyphen.

There are [conflicting ideas](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2180465/can-someone-have-a-subdomain-hostname-with-an-underscore-in-it/14622263#14622263) and follow-up RFCs, at this point, I'm unclear as to whether this domain name is technically invalid.

There is a distinction between "host names" and "domain names". I'm still looking into "valid domain names."
